# Project Title

Early Detection of Nephritis using Machine Learning

## Overview

This project builds a machine learning model to predict nephritis based on patient symptoms. The system helps in early screening and clinical decision support.

## Features

Data preprocessing and encoding

Exploratory Data Analysis

Multiple model comparison

Hyperparameter tuning

Cross-validation

SHAP model explainability

Streamlit deployment

## Best Model

Random Forest
Accuracy: ~97–100%

## How to Run

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
streamlit run app.py
```
